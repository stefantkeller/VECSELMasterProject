\section{Results and Discussion}
\label{sec:eval}

In this section
I discuss
the power scaling
of our device,
the thus learned lessons
in order to improve the performance,
and an assessment of
the usefulness
of the thermal resistance
as a figure of merit
to evaluate
the samples.
I close this section
with the presentation
of an unexpected behavior
of the reflectivity
of our VECSEL device.
