\subsection{Pump spot scalability}
\label{sec:eval:pumpspot}

One way to augment the output power
is to increase the pumped area
\cite{Tropper2006,Chernikov2010,Korpi2010}.
A power scalable device
would increase the output power
proportional to the irradiated area.
As described in section~\ref{sec:rth:scaling},
this ideal description
doesn't work for real VECSELs;
the lateral cooling
is important
after all
\cite{Chernikov2010}.

By investigating
the scaling behavior
we can learn about
the limits
of the performance
of our device.
We vary the pump spot size
using lenses with various focal lengths
in order to image the $200\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ diameter fiber
onto sample 1,
see section~\ref{sec:exp:setup}.
For the scaling experiments
I irradiated spot A
indicated in Fig.~\ref{img:sample_surface}.
Because of the change
of lens $\mathrm{L}_\mathrm{p2}$
and the subsequent
realignment of the setup,
I cannot ensure to have hit the exact same spot.
The employed cameras help us
to find it approximately,
but the remaining uncertainty is hard to estimate.
I imply the sample is homogeneous enough on this scale.
Each data point
is measured $N=3$ times.
