\section{Thermal resistance}
\label{sec:rth}

The thermal resistance ($\Rth$) is
the only experimentally accessible quantity
to asses the heat flow
in the structure \cite{Heinen2012}.
The thermal management
of a VECSEL is of critical importance
\cite{Tropper2006,Kemp2008,Vetter2012,Giet2008}.
Consequentially,
we're interested to determine $\Rth$.
It is a useful
figure of merit
to keep track of improvements
on design and manufacturing process
of VECSEL technology.
The thermal resistance
describes how much the sample heats up ($\d T$)
as a result of the dissipated power $\d D$
\begin{equation}
\d T = \Rth \d D \quad \Rightarrow \quad \Rth = \pd{T}{D}.
\label{eq:rth}
\end{equation}

There are several methods deployed
to determine
the thermal resistance,
an overview can be found in \cite{Heinen2012}.
Most of them are time and equipment intensive.
This is impractical
in order to monitor
improvements made in a design and
manufacturing process.
More simple approaches are desired.
For this report
I review two methods
that are supposed to be
just that.
