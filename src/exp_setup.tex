\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:exp}

The main objective
is to look at the high power regime,
attractive for intra-cavity frequency mixing.
For this,
I report on the light-light performance
of $1270\,\mathrm{nm}$ waveband VECSELs
with wafer fused gain mirrors
set in the flip-chip heat dissipation scheme,
see section~\ref{sec:basics}.
The light-light characteristics
relates the pumped input power
with the converted
emission power.
is recorded for various heat sink temperatures.
To asses the thermal management
we determine the thermal resistance
of our device.
Following section \ref{sec:rth},
we have to keep track of
the pumped,
reflected,
and emitted power,
and the emitted spectra.
